# Deployment

The final step in the tutorial is to register the new resources with the cortex webapp, and start it up.

**Note:** To navigate to a particular line in IntelliJ: 
1. From the top navigation menu, choose Navigate, then Line, or 
2. Press Ctrl+G on your keyboard. 

* Modify the ext-cortex webapp `pom.xml`, found at `cortex/ext-cortex-webapp/`. You will need to add a dependency on your `resource-api artifact`, as well as your `resource-prototype` artifact. Add the following code after  `<!-- Add Extension resources or Integration modules as maven dependencies here. -->` _(after line 40)_:

```xml
    <dependency>
    	<artifactId>terms-and-conditions-api</artifactId>
    	<groupId>com.elasticpath.extensions.rest.definitions</groupId>
    	<version>${project.version}</version>
    	<scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
    	<artifactId>terms-and-conditions-prototype</artifactId>
    	<groupId>com.elasticpath.extensions.rest.resource</groupId>
    	<version>${project.version}</version>
    	<scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>

```

* Navigate to the `<artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>` section _(found around line 1080)_. Check that the `groupdId`s of the new modules are included in the `<includeGroupIds>` section. Add them if they are not.

```xml
    com.elasticpath.extensions.rest.repositories,
	com.elasticpath.extensions.rest.resource
```

* Immediately following, within the same `pom.xml`, include the following code at the bottom of the list in the `<excludeArtifactIds>` section _(found around line 1100)_:

```xml
    ep-rest-definitions-schema
```

_**Hint:** Notice how each `artifactId` except the last `artifactId` in the list has a `,` to separate it from the previous `artifactId`_


* Open a command prompt.

* Cd to `extensions/cortex/ext-commerce-engine-wrapper` and execute the following command. 

```sh
mvn clean install -DskipAllTests
``` 

## Testing the extended resource in Cortex Studio

* Deploy the `Cortex` webapp using `mvn clean tomcat7:run-war` (from `\extensions\cortex\ext-cortex-webapp\`).

* Once the webapp deploys, launch `Elastic Path Cortex Studio` in your web browser in a new session.

* Authenticate as `PUBLIC` user under the scope `mobee`.

_Reminder: the scope is the store you are authenticating against_

* Navigate to the `Shopper's Current Order` using the Quick Links on the bottom portion of the right hand side panel.

* Check that the `termsandconditions` resource is listed. _(If it is not there, shut down the webapps and return to your code to troubleshoot.)_
Verify it has the following structure:

```
{
    type: "needinfo", 
    id: "terms.not.accepted", 
    debug-message: "Terms must be accepted before making a purchase.", 
    linked-to: {
        uri: "/terms/mobee/mfrdmytfmi2gcljsgy2wkljumvqtoljzmqydellcgeztqmjrg44dkolbgi=", 
        href: "http://localhost:9080/cortex/terms/mobee/mfrdmytfmi2gcljsgy2wkljumvqtoljzmqydellcgeztqmjrg44dkolbgi=", 
        type: "terms.terms-and-conditions-form"
    }
}
```

* Add the item with sku code `alien_sku` to your cart.

* Navigate back to the `Shopper's Current Order`.

* At the top, you will see advisors indicating that `email`, `billing address`, and `paymentmethodinfo` must still be completed. Click on the hrefs to complete the missing information.

* Click on the href for the `terms-and-conditions` advisor. Perform a `PUT` operation on that resource and enter `true` into the accepted field, it should update the `isAccepted` property. Validate that the update is successful, and that the `TermsFormResource` accepted property has been updated by returning to the `GET` operation.

```
{
   self: {
      type: "terms.terms-and-conditions-form", 
      uri: "/terms/mobee/<TERMS_ID>", 
      href: "http://localhost:9080/cortex/terms/mobee/<TERMS_ID>"
   }, 
   messages: [ ], 
   accepted: true, 
   message: "Do you accept the Terms and Conditions?", 
   links: [ ]
}
```

* Open the database and check the TCARTORDER and TCARTORDERTNCS tables. Verify rows have been added for this cart order. 

* Upon navigating back to the `Shopper's Current Order`, you will notice that there are no more advisors on the `termsandconditions` resource. 

* Go to the purchase form and submit the order.

* Return to the database and note the order data has been removed from the TCARTORDER and TCARTORDERTNCS tables and inserted into the TORDER and TORDERDATA tables.  


_**Hint:** If you get the below error when trying to submit an order, try to figure out which web app you forgot to launch_
